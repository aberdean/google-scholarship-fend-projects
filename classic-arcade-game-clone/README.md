## Introduction
This is a version of the classic game Frogger, developed as a demonstration
on how to use object-oriented JavaScript.

## Instructions
The game board consists of two rows of grass on the bottom, three rows of paved
road in the middle and one row of water at the top.

The player's character is situated on the bottom row of grass and to win
the game, you need to safely take it to the water at the top of the board,
while avoiding the enemy bugs.

  * #### How to Run

      To run the game, download it and double click on the `index.html` file.

  * #### How to Play

      Using the 4 arrow keys, `up`, `down`, `left`, and `right`, move the
      character all the way from the bottom of the board to the top to reach
      the water.

      Your character is safe on the two bottom rows of grass, but watch out for
      the bugs on the paved roads, because if you hit one of the bugs, the game
      will be reset and you will have to start again.

      If you manage to reach the water, you win the game!

      When you win a game, you can run your character against one of the bugs
      to start playing again.
