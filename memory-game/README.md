## Introduction

This is a version of the classic game Concentration.
It is developed in HTML/CSS/JS.

## Instructions

The game starts with a grid of 16 cards covered up.

* To play the game, click on two cards to flip them, trying to match their
symbols.

  * If the symbols match, the cards will be locked and you will be able to
go ahead and select two more cards.

  * If the symbols don't match, the cards will be covered again and you will 
have to continue flipping two cards at a time, trying to find matches.

* You win when you are able to match all the cards.
