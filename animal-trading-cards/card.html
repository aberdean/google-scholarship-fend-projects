			<p>Humans are very curious animals, with very peculiar habits. They distinguish themselves from all other animals for taking selfies and, among the other things, for gossiping about other humans but complaining when other humans gossip about them. They are the only animals that need to earn money and spend it to be able to survive. They also spend money in many other creative ways: for water, for speaking with one another over the phone, or for paying taxes to their own countries.</p>
